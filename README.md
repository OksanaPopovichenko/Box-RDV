## Design System

I used the Atomic Design Methodology to create the components for the design system.
https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/

Therefore, the components are divided into:
1. atoms (Button, Checkbox, Input)
2. molecules (ButtonGroup, Card) 
3. organisms (Client, Date, Service, Tabbar)

## Notes

1. How the state of the Tabbar changes was not clear in Figma, so I implemented different options, but I always display only one by default.

2. I didn't have time to implement everything in 2 days :)
